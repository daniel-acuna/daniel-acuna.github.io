I am looking for Ph.D. students with strong quantitative background and 
programming skills with interests around:

  - [Studying and predicting scientific innovation](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/abs/489201a.html) with AI-based methods.
  - Quantifying how humans extend their capabilities with technology in [ecologically-plausible sequential decisions](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12176).
  - Applying AI-based methods to automatically summarize scientific results from large-scale scientific corpora

The methods and techniques used in my research include:

  - Big data Machine Learning with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) including bagging and boosting
  - Deep learning with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  - Bayesian statistics
  - Python, R, Hadoop, and SQL.

Please take a look at my [research](/research/) and if you have questions, 
send me an email to `deacuna AT syr DOT edu`.
Otherwise, [apply to the Ph.D. program](https://ischool.syr.edu/admissions/checklists/phd-checklist/) and mention my name in you materials.
