## About the lab

Dr. Acuna is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Studies 
at Syracuse University. He currently
works on mathematical and computational models of scientific discovery, predictability,
and integrity. Please take a moment to look
at his [background](/about/), [research](/research/), and [recent grants](/funding/).

Professor Acuna teaches courses for the 
Applied Data Science 
and Information Management graduate degrees. He is currently the teacher and Professor of Record for 
the course IST 718: Advanced Information Analytics.

Past Master's students have done internships in Silicon Valley (e.g., Airbnb), 
are working in major consulting companies (e.g., Ernst & Young,  Goldman Sachs), and are 
broadly working as data scientists. Please see the [People section](/people/). 

## About the position
 
Professor Acuna is looking for Ph.D. and first-year Master's students to work on an exciting new project
around the mathematical and computational modeling of scientific peer review. The ideal candidate 
should have an undergraduate major in Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Statistics, Mathematics, 
or a similar quantitative field. The work to be done revolves around a recently-awarded 
[NSF grant]({% post_url 2018-06-22-optimizing-scientific-peer-review %}).


### Requirements

- Develop reproducible software and tools to optimally match reviewers and manuscripts based on
 mathematical objective functions
- Write method and result sections for scientific manuscripts
- Have advanced computer programming skills in languages such as Python and R. SQL is also
desirable
- Understand linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics
- Understand machine learning software tools and pipelines in `scikit-learn`, `R`, or `Spark ML`
- Understand basic concepts of software engineering
- Have good communication skills

### Qualifications

- Undergraduate (for MS students) or graduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, 
Applied Statistics, Applied Mathematics, or similar quantitative fields
- Minimum of 2 years of experience with coding in a major programming language such as 
Python, R, C, C++, or Java. Experience with handling big data with Apache Spark is a plus.
- Demonstrable knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics


## Apply

__If you are an SU's iSchool student__, use the Faculty Assistantship application and look for the position entitled 
_Multiple Data Science positions available for first-year Master's students_.
