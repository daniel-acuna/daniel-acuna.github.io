## About the lab

Dr. Acuna is an Assistant Professor in the [School of Information Studies](http://ischool.syr.edu) 
at [Syracuse University](http://syracuse.edu). He currently
works on mathematical and computational models of scientific discovery, predictability,
and integrity. Please take a moment to look
at his [background](/about/), [research](/research/), and [recent grants](/funding/).
In particular, look at his previous work on 
[predicting scientific success](https://www.nature.com/articles/489201a), [recommendation systems for
science](http://eileen.io), and [peer review panel formation](http://pr.scienceofscience.org).

Professor Acuna teaches courses for the 
[Applied Data Science](https://ischool.syr.edu/academics/graduate/masters-degrees/ms-in-applied-data-science/) 
and [Information Management](https://ischool.syr.edu/academics/graduate/masters-degrees/ms-in-information-management/) graduate degrees. He is currently the teacher and Professor of Record for 
[IST 718: Advanced Information Analytics]({% post_url 2018-02-18-IST718 %}).

Past Masters students have done internships in Silicon Valley (e.g., Airbnb), 
are working in major consulting companies (e.g., Ernst & Young,  Goldman Sachs), and are 
broadly working as data scientists. Please see the [People section](/people/). 

## About the position
 
Professor Acuna is looking for Ph.D. and first-year Masters students to work on an exciting new project
around the mathematical and computational modeling of scientific peer review. The ideal candidate 
should have an undergraduate major in Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Statistics, Mathematics, 
or a similar quantitative field. The work to be done revolves around a recently-awarded 
[NSF grant]({% post_url 2018-06-22-optimizing-scientific-peer-review %}).


### Requirements

- Develop reproducible software and tools to optimally match reviewers and manuscripts based on
 mathematical objective functions
- Write method and result sections for scientific manuscripts
- Have advanced computer programming skills in languages such as Python and R. SQL is also
desirable
- Understand linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics
- Understand machine learning software tools and piplines in `scikit-learn`, `R`, or `Spark ML`
- Understand basic concepts of software engineering
- Have good communication skills

### Qualifications

- Undergraduate (for MS students) or graduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, 
Applied Statistics, Applied Mathematics, or similar quantitative fields
- Minimum of 2 years of experience with coding in a major programming language such as 
Python, R, C, C++, or Java. Experience with handling big data with Apache Spark is a plus.
- Demonstrable knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics

__Positions are available immediately. For Masters students, only first-year students will be considered__

If you have any questions, please send an email to `deacuna AT syr DOT edu`. If you are thinking
of applying to the Ph.D. program, we have a very competitive __fully-funded program__, and you
should contact me first. Otherwise,
