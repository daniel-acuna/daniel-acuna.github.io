### Abstract

Fraudulent reuse of scientific figures is an increasingly common problem that 
damages the public perception of science. 
The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) reviews whistleblowers' accusations carefully,
 taking a reactive approach to investigate this type of misconduct. 
 Recently, Acuna, Brookes, and Kording (2018) used machine learning to detect 
 figure reuse in PubMed Open Access articles which share same junior or senior 
 scientist. They estimated that around 0.6% of the papers were very likely fraudulent.
 Current image manipulation investigations are however reactive, 
 not across-authors scalable, originated from whistleblowers, and without 
 statistically-supported verdicts. 

In this project, we propose to dramatically scale automated detection 
of figure reuse across articles and collaborate with ORIs and active 
researchers in the area. We also propose to develop statistical methods 
to support conclusions regarding figure reuses. Once this project is completed, 
we hope that the tools and techniques that we will develop will 
become a standard practice. We expect our research to significantly 
reduce the acceptance of publications with image manipulation and 
therefore significantly reduce the incidence of one of the most 
damaging instances of scientific misconduct.
