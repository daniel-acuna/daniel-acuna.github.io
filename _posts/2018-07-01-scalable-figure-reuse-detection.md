### Abstract

In this project, we propose to dramatically scale automated detection 
of figure reuse across articles and collaborate with ORIs and active 
researchers in the area. We also propose to develop statistical methods 
to support conclusions regarding figure reuses. Once this project is completed, 
we hope that the tools and techniques that we will develop will 
become a standard practice. We expect our research to significantly 
reduce the acceptance of publications with image manipulation and 
therefore significantly reduce the incidence of one of the most 
damaging instances of scientific misconduct.
